Document/Photo Indexing:
Indexing is the process of organizing documents or photos by extracting relevant metadata (such as title, date, tags, and keywords) and assigning them to a structured database or system. This allows for efficient retrieval and management of large collections of files.
Searching for Indexed Files:
Once documents or photos are indexed, users can search for files using keywords, metadata, or specific attributes. The search engine or system uses the index to quickly locate and retrieve relevant files without scanning the entire document collection.
